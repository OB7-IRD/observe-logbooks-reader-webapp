# Longline


## Is there previous trip ?

Once you have uploaded the longline logbook in the platform, the webapp will look for all the previous trip registered in the database for the program entered and the vessel you are submitting. 

- If it's the first time the vessel is entered in this program, you will get to enter a new trip :
