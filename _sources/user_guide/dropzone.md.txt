# Dropzone 

You access to the dropzone area from the header with the 'Logbook' category.

You get to a web page where you can choose to update the referential data. They are loaded once a day at your first connexion but you may want to get them again if the database changed in between. 

On this page you will have to select different option depending on the data you are submitting : 

- the domain : Purse seine or longline 
- the program 
- the ocean
- the type of document


Once you filled these, you will have a dropzone where you can load your logbook from .xlsx .xlm
