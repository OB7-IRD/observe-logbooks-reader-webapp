# Django webapp

Developed by Adelphe and Clémentine

## Global introduction

To briefly introduce the Django webapp : 
The aim is to automatically send different sourced files to the [Observe](https://umr-marbec.fr/en/the-observatories/ob7) database (add a better link there). 
The sourcing files can be logbooks, observations files or ERS data. 

For now, the app is developed for the purseiners' logbooks and in development for the purseiners' observations files (or ERS - not sure what Adelphe is doing) and longliners' logbooks. 

The input data varies depending on the type of fishering we are studying (purseiners - ps/longliners - ll). The webapp project is then sliced into the ps and the ll. 


## Webapp navigation

To access the webapp, a connection trough the Observe database id is mandatory. 

Afterwards, depending on the data you have and want to send to the database, you get to choose : 

* the ocean,
* the type of fishering,
* the program you want the data to go in, 
* the type of input data you have (logbooks, observation, ERS)

You then get to the drop zone platfrom. Selecting all the previous info helps the webapp to treat the specific input data you are submitting. You can then send them to the Observe api. If there is some types errors in the cells or some unexpected operating informations, you will be notified.


## Project layout

Here we present the hierarchical structure of the webapp

(Still in construction)

        api-traitement # Code for conecting, getting infos for the Observe api

        media # Where the referential are stocked 

        palangre-syc  # Code related to the Seychelles' longliners logbooks
        
        webapps # Code for the common parts - when the operator get to fill the the form
        
            media # temporary files - where the dropped logbooks are stocked before being send
        
        website # Where the settings are - (?)
        
        manage.py # file needed to launch the app
